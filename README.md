## Description
**[KISMET-INC.github.io](https://kismet-inc.github.io/index.html)** is a website to display my work as a **Full Stack Web Developer** in a professional manner. It was launched from a template to be ready in a timely manner post-graduation. **While this website model is entirely HTML, Javascript, and CSS in was generated using several other technologies such as [Gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), and [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)**. The backbone of this repository and the codebase that I edited directly is located at **[KISMET-INC/portfolio-dev](https://github.com/KISMET-INC/portfolio-dev)**.

> Note: The word **KISMET** was chosen not just for its meaning but also as a meaningful shorthand to my name.
